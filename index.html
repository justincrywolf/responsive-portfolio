            <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="headshot" alt="Headshot" />

            <p>When I was in third grade I wrote an essay about what I wanted to be when I grew up. I think we can all see that I didn't end up singing bass for The Pointer Sisters as I planned, but I've found a calling in start-up culture. </p>

            <p>Working in a start-up is an experience of rapid-fire enrichment. On any given day I might be asked to spend an afternoon learning to do something I've never done before in preparation for creating something for a client the next day. Seeing my work have a very immediate impact on the company is immensely satisfying, and possibly my favorite part of start-up culture.</p>
